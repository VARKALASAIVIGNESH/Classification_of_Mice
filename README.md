# Classification_of_mice
The goal of this project was to analyze protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of mice to classify them into different categories based on their genotype, behavior, and treatment. Objective

Classify Mice Based on Protein Expression: Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify mice into one of the eight classes based on the expression levels of 77 proteins. These classes are determined by a combination of genotype (control or trisomic), behavior (stimulated to learn or not), and treatment (saline or memantine).
Identify Key Discriminant Proteins: Utilize feature selection techniques to identify which proteins or protein modifications are most important for distinguishing between the different classes. Understanding which proteins are key discriminators can provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying learning and memory in Down syndrome.
Evaluate the Impact of Genotype, Behavior, and Treatment: Analyze the effect of genotype (control vs. trisomic), behavior (context-shock vs. shock-context), and treatment (saline vs. memantine) on protein expression levels. This includes evaluating how these factors influence associative learning and the potential therapeutic effects of memantine in trisomic mice.
